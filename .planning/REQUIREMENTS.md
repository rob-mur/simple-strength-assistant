# Requirements: Simple Strength Assistant

**Defined:** 2026-03-01
**Core Value:** Users must be able to reliably persist their workout data to a file they control on their device.

## v1.1 Requirements

Exercise Library milestone - centralized view to browse and search exercises.

### Exercise Library

- [ ] **LIB-01**: User can view Exercise Library tab in the main interface
- [ ] **LIB-02**: User can switch between Workout and Library tabs without losing active session
- [ ] **LIB-03**: User can see all exercises they've created in a list view
- [ ] **LIB-04**: User can search exercises by name with instant filtering
- [ ] **LIB-05**: User sees exercise type indicator (weighted vs bodyweight) for each exercise
- [ ] **LIB-06**: User sees clear empty state message when no exercises exist

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Exercise Metadata

- **LIB-07**: User can see last performed date for each exercise
- **LIB-08**: User can see total sessions count for each exercise

### Exercise Management

- **LIB-09**: User can archive exercises to hide from library
- **LIB-10**: User can edit exercise name and settings

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Pre-populated exercise database | User builds personal library through workouts; avoids naming conflicts and bloat |
| Exercise categorization by muscle group | Adds complexity without validation; users already know exercise names |
| Delete exercises | Archive instead to preserve workout history and prevent orphaned data |
| Exercise video/image tutorials | Massive storage overhead, scope creep; user can Google form cues |
| Workout prescription from library | Belongs in future prescription milestone, not library browsing |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LIB-01 | TBD | Pending |
| LIB-02 | TBD | Pending |
| LIB-03 | TBD | Pending |
| LIB-04 | TBD | Pending |
| LIB-05 | TBD | Pending |
| LIB-06 | TBD | Pending |

**Coverage:**
- v1.1 requirements: 6 total
- Mapped to phases: 0 (pending roadmap)
- Unmapped: 6 ⚠️

# Phase 05-02: Exercise List Component and Type Badges

## Goal
Implement the core exercise list view in Dioxus to display all existing exercises, including visual type badges (weighted vs bodyweight). Connect these UI components to the `@unit` BDD tests to ensure they pass.

## Requirements Covered
- LIB-03
- LIB-05
- LIB-06 (partially - empty state for no exercises)

## Context
Following the TDD/BDD pattern, we implement the behavior to satisfy the `tests/features/exercise_list.feature` scenarios.

## Tasks

<task>
1. Implement the `LibraryView` component:
   - Read the global list of exercises from `WorkoutState`.
   - Iterate over the exercises to render list items.
   - Show a "No exercises yet. Add exercises during your first workout." placeholder when the state has no exercises.
</task>

<task>
2. Add Type Badges to exercises:
   - Identify whether an exercise is "Weighted" or "Bodyweight" based on its properties.
   - Render a visual pill/badge on the UI next to the exercise name.
</task>

<task>
3. Hook up `@unit` tests in `exercise_list_bdd.rs`:
   - Write step definitions using `wasm-bindgen-test` inside `tests/steps/exercise_list_steps.rs`.
   - Render `LibraryView` virtually and verify that DOM nodes (list items, badges, empty state) appear correctly given seeded state.
</task>

## Verification
- Run `cargo test --test exercise_list_bdd -- --tags @unit`. All scenarios must pass.
- BDD step definitions accurately simulate component state.

## Must Haves
- The `LibraryView` handles empty lists gracefully.
- The badges explicitly distinguish weighted vs bodyweight without ambiguity.

# Phase 05-01: BDD Feature Files and Test Harness Setup

## Goal
Establish the BDD feature files for the Exercise List & Search requirements and set up the corresponding Rust testing entry points, defining scenarios with `@e2e` and `@unit` tags.

## Requirements Covered
- LIB-03
- LIB-04
- LIB-05
- LIB-06

## Context
Following the strict BDD-first pattern, we must define the Cucumber specifications before writing component logic. These scenarios capture the user constraints outlined in CONTEXT.md and structure the work for the upcoming waves.

## Tasks

<task>
1. Create `tests/features/exercise_list.feature`:
   - Define a feature for "Exercise List Display" (LIB-03, LIB-05).
   - Write scenarios for viewing populated exercise lists and verifying the presence of "bodyweight" vs "weighted" badges.
   - Tag appropriate fast feedback scenarios as `@unit`.
   - Tag one comprehensive end-to-end scenario as `@e2e`.
</task>

<task>
2. Create `tests/features/exercise_search.feature`:
   - Define a feature for "Exercise Search and Filtering" (LIB-04, LIB-06).
   - Write scenarios for instant text filtering (case-insensitive) and empty states ("No matching exercises" and "No exercises yet").
   - Tag fast filtering logic scenarios as `@unit`.
   - Tag one end-to-end user flow as `@e2e`.
</task>

<task>
3. Create Cucumber Rust test runners:
   - Create `tests/exercise_list_bdd.rs` setting up the Cucumber runner and invoking the feature file.
   - Create `tests/exercise_search_bdd.rs` setting up the runner.
   - Leave the `World` implementation and step definitions mostly unimplemented/stubbed for subsequent tasks, or hook them up to basic `Dioxus` component tests if applicable.
</task>

## Verification
- Running `cargo test --test exercise_list_bdd` should execute and show scenarios as pending or failing.
- Running `cargo test --test exercise_search_bdd` should execute and show scenarios as pending or failing.
- All scenarios are properly tagged with `@unit` or `@e2e`.

## Must Haves
- Gherkin syntax is valid and accurately maps to LIB-03 through LIB-06.
